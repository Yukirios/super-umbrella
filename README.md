# This code contains my try-out on describing absorption spectra, yet subtly :D

What the program does?
  1. Reads a formated excel sheet - wavelength and absorption as columns
  2. Defines global and relative maxima, sets them onto graph
  3. Shows global maximum, the most intense one, via dashed line
  4. Outputs the stuff above as a graph

In order to work, set filepath in "read" part and set prefered columns to use, as well the 'n'-variable if needed after getting not suitable green dots on plot
