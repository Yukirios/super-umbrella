# This code contains my try-out on describing absorption spectra, yet subtly :D

What the program does?
  1. Reads a formated excel sheet - wavelength and absorption as columns
  2. Prints out the content of this sheet
  3. Plots it as a test
  4. Defines global and relative maxima, sets them onto graph
  5. Shows global maximum, the most intense one, via dashed line
  6. Outputs the stuff above as a text under graph with little explanation
